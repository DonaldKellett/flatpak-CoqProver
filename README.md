# flatpak-CoqProver

Manifest and associated files for building a working Coq environment for Flatpak (WIP)

## License

Haven't figured this out yet, but feel free to clone this repo and try to build the Flatpak yourself from the given files.

If you want to work on this with me, feel free to open an issue ticket in the issue tracker requesting to be a collaborator and I will give you edit rights to this repository.

A proper license will be added once this project is in usable shape and the Coq development team has been consulted w.r.t. legal matters.
